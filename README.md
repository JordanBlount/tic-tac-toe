## Tic Tac Toe - The Odin Project

My version of a tic tac toe game.

I admit that when I saw this challenge I was confused for a second about how the logic would be for this game. I sat down for a minute and wrote down some of my thoughts on paper before even touching [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This helped me to better organize my thoughts while approaching the code.
