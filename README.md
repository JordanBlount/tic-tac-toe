## Tic Tac Toe - The Odin Project

My version of a tic tac toe game.

I admit that when I saw this challenge I was confused for a second about how the logic would be for this game. I sat down for a minute and wrote down some of my thoughts on paper before even touching [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This helped me to better organize my thoughts while approaching the code. My implementation is not exactly like what is written on this page (if you can understand my handwriting). It was just a starting place.
